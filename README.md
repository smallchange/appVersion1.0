# Small Change
Small Change is a financial literacy mobile application designed to empower end users to make small behavioral changes, raise awareness for financial literacy issues, and generate funds for financial literacy programs through United Way Ottawa (UWO).
 
# Objectives
Small Change primary objective is helping end users make small behavioral changes that lead to financial savings. The other objectives include enhancing general financial literacy, distributing compelling information to end users, improving positive brand impressions for advertisers, and raising money for United Way Ottawa’s financial literacy initiatives.
 
The application tracks individual behavioral changes by capturing three points of data: A description of the behaviour the user wants to change, the current frequency of the behaviour, and the cost of that specific behaviour. An additional field is being considered where the user can identify a tangible financial end goal they want to achieve.
 
For example: Jane, an end user, wants to reduce her weekly coffee shop purchases so that she can save money for a vacation. Jane visits the coffee shop three times a week and spends on average $5 per visit. Every day that Jane brews her coffee at home she records this behaviour by tapping a coffee cup icon within the application. Over a normal work week (5 days) Jane spends $15. Therefore, Jane saves $3 every day she doesn’t purchase a coffee.
 
This example is applicable to dozens of behaviours including, making a lunch versus purchasing, using public transportation versus using your own car/paying for parking, using a reusable container versus buying a beverage, smoking versus not smoking, and incurring ATM fees. The application will make initial suggestions on the common behaviours people want to change. Users will also have the opportunity to create their own items.
